Tableau


## Overview of the analysis: 
We are trying to convince investors of the viable opportunity in the bike-sharing business in Des Moines. Using Tablaeu, we have produced a number of visuals to show investors more about the target market.


## Results: 
Here is the [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/madelyn.mathai#!/vizhome/Challenge_16151828806170/Module14?publish=yes)

## Summary: 
On a high level, the overwhelming majority of bike users are men. Perhaps more marketing should be done to attract more female riders, but male users seem to be a reliable market. Most of the men are subscribers, not regular customers. Most bike trips across genders are less than an hour long. Most of the bike trips are during commute times, so users seem to be using the bikes more for transportation rather than leisure.

If I were to do 2 additional visualizations, I might look into all of these questions but rather than filtering by gender, perhaps filter by birth year. This could inform us of our target demographic, which can inform potential marketing and outreach decisions. I would also want to know where these customers are biking to/from during their commute, to better inform outreach.
